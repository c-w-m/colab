# [Get started with using TensorFlow to solve for regression problems (Coding TensorFlow)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vHQub0NXI4)

You often have to solve for regression problems when training your machine learning models. In this episode of Coding TensorFlow, Developer Advocate Robert Crowe discusses how to build and train a TensorFlow model using Keras, where you are looking for the model to solve for a single numerical result - in other words, regression.. Learn how to get started on regression problems, and watch to see an example involving miles-per-gallon. This requires our model to examine and learn from the data we provide, in order to predict our final number. Subscribe to the TensorFlow [YouTube channel for more!](http://bit.ly/TensorFlow1)
